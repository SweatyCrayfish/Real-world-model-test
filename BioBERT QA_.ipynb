dot-1.1 pol ii h2b ets1 kras is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer and kras inhibition has been a longtime goal. recently inhibitors (g12c-is) that bind kras-g12c-gdp and react with cys-12 were developed. using new affinity reagents to monitor kras-g12c activation and inhibitor engagement we found that shp2 inhibitors (shp2-is) increased kras-gdp occupancy enhancing g12c-i efficacy. shp2-is abrogated feedback signaling by multiple rtks and adaptive resistance to g12c-is in vitro in xenografts and in syngeneic kras-g12c-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac) and non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) models. the combination of shp2-i and g12c-i evoked favorable changes in the immune microenvironment decreasing myeloid suppressor cells increasing cd8+ t cells and sensitizing tumors to pd-1 blockade. experiments using an inhibitor-resistant shp2 mutant showed that shp2 inhibition in pdac cells is required for tumor regression and remodeling of the immune microenvironment but shp2-is also had direct effects on angiogenesis. our results demonstrate that shp2-i/g12c-i combinations confer a substantial survival benefit in pdac and nsclc and identify additional potential combination strategies. g12c-is show significant but limited efficacy as single agents in part because of ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93adaptive resistanceã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d. we find that combining g12c-is with shp2-is abrogates adaptive resistance and results in favorable changes in the immune microenvironment that potentiate pd-1 blockade in kras-mutant malignancies. shp2-is also can have direct context-dependent effects on tumor vasculature. rb1 p130 p107 ahr cyp1a1 cyp1a2 cyp1b1 nqo1 fmo2 fmo3 p53 cct4 anticarin-ã\\x8eâ² tfa tfr1b alas2 slc25a37 rpl11 pv-cre tdtomato dnmt1loxp top1
